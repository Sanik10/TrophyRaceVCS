NOTE 1: The auto configured prefabs adapt the needed image effects on the camera, using the
"AutoConfigureSM" script. The "AddSmoothSun" option configures the new global controller for the latest full volumetric clouds (Clouds script on camera), 
which controls the cloud density per weather type, the cloud colors per time of day and also adds a lerped SunMoon transform that is used 
to smoothly lerp the cloud lighting at dusk and dawn, than the direct toggle between sun and moon lights.
The Global Controller script is included in the prefab in the "SMOOTH SUN CONTROLLER" object ("ControlWeatherTOD_SM_SRP" script).

NOTE 2:
The prefab is unpacked on insertion. If need to create a new prefab, make sure that the
"ControlWeatherTOD_SM_SRP" script is deactivated when create the prefab and the "AutoConfigureSM" script is activated 
and the "Configured" checkbox is turned off in the prefab before insert to scene, so the configuration takes place.
