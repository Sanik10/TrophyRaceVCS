The latest prefab is recommended for direct use (mainly for dekstop usage, refer to first video above).

FLY THROUGH CLOUDS
For desktop and fly through clouds, drag the prefab named "SKY MASTER v5.4 Prefab - Full Volume Clouds - Smooth Sun - No Water  - Automatic Setup Weather Map"
in an existing scene with a camera, the prefab will auto configure the system on the camera tagged as Main Camera.

BACKGROUND CLOUDS
For desktop with no need for fly through and only need of clouds as background, can alternatively drag the prefab named 
"SKY MASTER v4.2 Prefab - All systems & Volume Lighting LINEAR COLOR" in the scene
after deleting the current directional light and camera. Then camera can be replaced by any other, as
long as it is tagged as "MainCamera" and the one in the prefab is deleted.
If there is a need to keep an existing main camera, then drag the "SKY MASTER v4.9 Prefab - Volume Clouds LINEAR COLOR - Automatic Setup"
prefab in an existing scene and the system will auto configure all modules for this camera. 

FASTEST PERFORMANCE CLOUDS AND MOBILE
For lowest end mobile there is a dedicated prefab, that will also cover all older mobile phones (SM2.0).
Drag the prefab named SKY MASTER PREFAB MOBILE v4.6 in a scene without a camera and directional light.
The related demo scene name is "SkyMaster 3 Mobile Water Demo with Sky v3.3" in "EXTRA SM DEMOS AND ASSETS" folder.
For faster mobiles or top performance in desktop can use the shader based clouds, by dragging the 
"SKY MASTER v3.5 Prefab - All systems & Volume Lighting LINEAR COLOR" prefab in a scene.

More details on the included prefab is also available in the "PREFAB NOTES" text file inside the PREFABS folder.

PROJECT CLEAN UP:
If need to reduce the disk size taken by the asset, can erase the demo scene and demo assets, 
which will not affect the prefabs and core modules of the system.

The folders that can be erased are
In "SkyMaster" folder:
"EXTRA SM DEMOS AND ASSETS" and "DEMOS" folders

In "ARTnGAME GI PROXY" folder: 
"EXTRA DEMO ASSETS" and "DEMOS" folders

Quick Tips:

NOTE 1: Add Volumetric Gradient Fog from Camera FX ("Add Volumetric Fog" button) section BEFORE adding the new Volume Clouds (InfiniCLOUD) to camera and set it up, 
when the step by step configuration is used.

NOTE 2: Add the new Volumetric Clouds (InfiniCLOUD) to camera by inserting "InfiniCLOUD" component in the camera object. Press the buttons to setup. Use after the
main Sky Master ULTIMATE system has been setup.

NOTE 3: If game crashes (actual build of the game) in Unity 2018.2 and above, probably is a Legacy Paricle conponent left in the scene.
Use the included converter in Assets -> Upgrade Legacy Particles, with the scene open to convert the Legacy to Shuriken and solve the issue. Also place 
a material for Lightning before any conversionn, as a lightning line renderer must also be created for the case lightning particles existed in the scene. 
"Lightning Mat 5" is the recommended material to use.

NOTE 4: Volumetric light shadows work with 4 cascades in shadow settings in some Unity versions.

NOTE 5: The system can be setup Step by step using the Configurator (SkyMaster script) or using the prefabs in the PREFABS folder
Use the v3.4 prefabs for older systems and mobiles and the v4.2 with the new clouds for stronger systems. The new clouds are compatible
with mobile as well (enable the WebGL option for that purpose and put the mobile factor to zero)

NOTE 6: The demo scenes can be used to customize and create new prefabs, just drag all items inside the main prefab object and Apply them
in inspector to get a new prefab.

NOTE 7: You may use the WeatherRandomizerSKYMASTER and TimerSKYMASTER scripts, attach them to the skymaster object and trigger random 
weather effects or set precision time. Those can be also used as base templates for scripting the system, they showcase how to change
weather and time of day by setting up the proper variables.

NOTE 8: Add a layer named "Background " before setting up blending of back layer in the new volume clouds (IndiniCLOUD).
Before press "Setup Back Layer" button, after inserting the InfiniCLOUD script in the camera and after having pressed the first button
to do the base cloud setup.

NOTE 9: The folders "DEMOS" and "EXTRA SM DEMOS AND ASSETS" and "EXTRA DEMO ASSETS" from the Sky Master and GI Proxy folders may be deleted 
or not inserted in the project to get the Barebone version of Sky Master, to minimize space taken in the project.

NOTE 10: Add the "Conductor" Tag in the project and in any item that would like to receive lightning in a storm.
Add the "Flamer" and "Flammable" tags to use the special FX like propagating fire and ice.
