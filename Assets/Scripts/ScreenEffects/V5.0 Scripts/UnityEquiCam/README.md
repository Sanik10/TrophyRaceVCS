Realtime 360° Camera for Unity
Place the script on your camera to transform it into a realtime 360° panorama renderer.  
This may degrade performance quickly! It uses 6 camera's to render to a cubemap in the background.   
-Works in Forward and Deferred rendering  
-Does not support most image effects
